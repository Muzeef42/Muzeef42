## About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Muzeef42 â€” a passionate programmer with a focus on Java, Python, and C.  
I have knowledge in data structures and algorithms, and some experience with HTML and CSS.  
Iâ€™m also eager to learn the MERN stack to build full-stack web applications.  

Currently, Iâ€™m working on improving my coding skills across multiple languages and expanding my understanding of data structures.
